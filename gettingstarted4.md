# Bonus: Try an analysis

The analysis produces results for each cell based on test data (if there are multiple files associated with a cell, it will concatenate the data in date order). Then it will correlate the results with the design properties defined on each cell. 

Click on the navigation button in the top-left and pick Analysis. You can select Experiment to analyze all the cells in one experiment, Pick Cells to select an arbitrary grouping of cells, or Pick Data to pick individual test data files.
