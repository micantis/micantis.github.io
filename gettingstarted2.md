# Create a cell. 

1. When you first open the software, it starts on the "Cells" table (to get back there, click the navigation button on the top left corner, then choose Cells). 

2. Find the button with a pencil and a plus sign in the top right corner and click it.

3. In the cell editing view you can enter a name, choose a cell design (click the '+' button to register your choice), and edit the cell design parameters. There are many menus and inputs in the cell specification you can explore.

4. Changing values here only edits this single cell. "Template" cell components, constituent materials, and whole cell designs can be saved and edited (and deleted) in the library. Experiments are faster way to define many cells (that's up next).
