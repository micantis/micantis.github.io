# Generate an experiment

1. Click on the navigation button in the top left corner and choose Experiments. 

2. You can open an existing experiment (double click) or create a new one from scratch (click the pencil/plus button in the top right corner).

3. The experiment menus let you define a set of control variables and noise variables. Then you can pick the design matrix from a range of DOEs. The experiment then will generate all the cells with the correct properties. You can build and test these cells, associate test data with the cell definitions, and analyze it as it's generated on the tester.

4. Start by choosing a "base" cell (don't forget to click the plus button to register your choice), and work your way through the experiment tabs from left to right. There are text tips on each page to help you get started.
