# Generate a report

1. Reports lets you configure automated PPTX templates that you can use over and over again to quickly generate similar reports with different data sets. Click on Reports in the left navigation bar. 

2. You can open an existing report (double click on an item) or create a new one from scratch (click the "Design a New Report" button at the top). Bold items are Report Templates and are the foundation of the reporting tool.

3. Once you've opened an item (or started a new template) you'll see that the report editor has two modes: Simple, and Advanced ("Editing Mode" in the top-left). Use simple mode to select data when using an existing report template. In this mode, just step through the data selections with the "Next" button (bottom right corner) to select all the data needed by the report template you are using. This is the simplest workflow, but requires someone in your organization (or at Micantis) to configure a report template for you. 

4. Advanced mode lets you add and remove slides, edit graphs and table definitions, and configure settings. In this mode, the left sidebar has the Data Sources at the top and the Report Slides in order below that. The right half of the window shows the menus and options for the item you have selected on the left. You can also navigate through all the menus in order by using the Back and Next buttons at the bottom.

4. Once you have at least one Report Slide with a Data Source that is populated, you can click Generate Report to create the PPTX output.
