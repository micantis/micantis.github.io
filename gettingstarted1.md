# Graph some data. 

1. Click the three horizontal lines (navigation) button in the top left corner of the window, and pick Graphs.

2. You'll see a list of data starting with most recent. You can double click on a few different items in the table to select them (tip: you can also right click on an item for more options).

3. Then choose a graph type from the drop-down menu at the bottom to open the graph. 

4. There are lots of options on the graph, including zooming in/out, adding/removing Y-axes, changing scales, and more. Right clicking offers you a menu as well. There's an "i" button in the bottom-right of the graph window that has helpful tips.
