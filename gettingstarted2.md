# See the status of the battery testers in your lab

1. Click on Lab in the left navigation bar.

2. Click on the button that says "Channels". This is the top button just to the right of the navigation bar. You will see a table of all the channels in your lab, with the current status of each one.

3. Click on "Notifications" and then click "Add Notification". You can choose which Tester to set a notification on, and which channel or range of channels. You can also choose which kind of trigger you want to use. Click ok.

4. Now that the notification is created, click the down-triangle on the left to open the settings. For temperature notifications, for example, you can enter the trigger temperature. You can also enter the notification action. For example, you could set a notification that texts you if a temperature sensor on one of your channels reads over 60 degrees C.
